# Business Analytics Project Tasks

## [1. Introduction to Business Analytics](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/1.ipynb)
- **a.** Collect data from a real-life business scenario and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.  
- **b.** Analyze customer data to identify trends and patterns that can be used for business decision-making.

## [2. Describing the Distribution of a Variable](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/2.ipynb)
- **a.** Obtain a dataset and calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, etc.) for a specific variable of interest.  
- **b.** Create visualizations (histograms, box plots) to depict the distribution of a variable and analyze its characteristics.

## [3. Finding Relationships Among Variables](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/3.ipynb)
- **a.** Use a dataset with multiple variables and perform correlation analysis to determine the strength and direction of relationships between pairs of variables.  
- **b.** Apply regression analysis to identify the relationship between an independent variable (e.g., advertising expenditure) and a dependent variable (e.g., sales revenue).

## [4. Business Intelligence Tools for Data Analysis](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/4.ipynb)
- **a.** Utilize a business intelligence tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) to extract insights from a dataset and create interactive visualizations for effective data analysis.

## [5. Probability and Probability Distributions](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/5.ipynb)
- **a.** Simulate a probability experiment (e.g., rolling dice) using programming and calculate the probabilities of different outcomes.  
- **b.** Generate random numbers from various probability distributions (normal, uniform, exponential) and analyze their properties.

## [6. Decision Making under Uncertainty](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/6.ipynb)
- **a.** Develop a decision tree model to make business decisions considering uncertainties and associated probabilities at each decision point.  
- **b.** Apply the concept of expected value to evaluate different decision alternatives and select the optimal one.

## [7. Sampling and Sampling Distributions](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/7.ipynb)
- **a.** Conduct a survey and collect data from a sample population, ensuring proper sampling techniques are employed.  
- **b.** Use the Central Limit Theorem to analyze the sampling distribution of a sample mean and estimate population parameters.

## [8. Confidence Interval Estimation](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/8.ipynb)
- **a.** Calculate confidence intervals for population means or proportions using sample data and interpret the results in a business context.  
- **b.** Apply bootstrapping techniques to estimate confidence intervals for non-parametric statistics.

## [9. Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/9.ipynb)
- **a.** Formulate null and alternative hypotheses related to a business problem, conduct a hypothesis test using appropriate statistical tests, and interpret the results.  
- **b.** Perform A/B testing on a website or marketing campaign to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and make data-driven decisions.

## [10. Regression Analysis and Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/10.ipynb)
- **a.** Develop a regression model to predict future sales based on historical data, assess model performance, and interpret the significance of predictor variables.  
- **b.** Apply time series analysis techniques (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing) to forecast future demand for a product or service, and evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts.

## [11. Optimization Modeling and Simulation Modeling](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/11.ipynb)
- **a.** Formulate an optimization model (e.g., linear programming, integer programming) to solve a real-world business problem and analyze the optimal solution.  
- **b.** Use simulation modeling to evaluate different business scenarios, such as capacity planning, inventory management, or pricing strategies, and assess their impact on performance metrics.

## [12. Analysis of Variance and Experimental Design](https://github.com/Unnatesh/ABA/blob/main/All%20practical/12.ipynb)
- **a.** Design and conduct an experiment to study the effects of different factors on a specific response variable, analyze the results using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and draw conclusions.  
- **b.** Implement a factorial experiment and analyze the main effects and interaction effects of factors using statistical techniques.
